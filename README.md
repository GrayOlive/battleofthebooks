# Battle of the Books

## About
Battle of the Books is a school competition primarily for grades 4 to 6 to promote reading. Students form teams and read a selection of 10 books to compete in a series of head to head quizes. The competition culinates in a series of playoff and ultimately a championship match.

##Books
Typically a selection of 10 young adult books is used for the competition. Each student is not expected to read all ten books but the team collectively should. Team members are encouraged to read 3 books to ensure there is some overlap in knowledge. 

Each year we have used the [Forest of Reading Silver Birch Fiction Award Nominees](https://forestofreading.com/silver-birch-nominees/) as our selection of 10 books. The award is part of the [Forest of Reading program](https://forestofreading.com), Canadaâ€™s largest recreational reading program run by the [Ontario Library Association](https://accessola.com). The Silver Birch Fiction award is for fiction books targetted at a Grade 5-6 reading level.

## Teams
Teams are usually made up of four players as it makes the challenge of reading all the books easier if it's spread amongst more players. In 2022 we had a total of 90 students participating over 20 teams both in person, remote, and hybrid. It made for a challenging schedule and implementation but it was exciting to see so many students participating.

##Timeline
Promotion of the competition starts in December and we kick off Battle of the Books in January with competitions during the month of April. This allows three months to read the suggested three books and we take approximately four weeks to run the competition depending on the number of teams. Multiple check-ins are done with the competitors and their parents to remind them of where they should be on their reading progression to be ready in time. Awards and prizes are given to the top three teams.
